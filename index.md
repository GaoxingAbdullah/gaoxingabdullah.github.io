## About Me

I recently graduated with my master's degree in Software Engineering at Zhejiang Normal University (ZJNU) (2025), 
 where I have the privilege of being mentored and guided by Professor Wang (Robert) Hui. 
Prior to pursuing my master's degree, I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science 
from the same university.
I'm currently serving as a 
gruduate researcher at the UbiSmart Lab, ZJNU, focusing on federated learning, Intenet of Things, 
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), and AI for security and Privacy under the mentorship of [Professor Ma Maode](http://qufaculty.qu.edu.qa/mamaode/home/) and Professor Wang Hui.
