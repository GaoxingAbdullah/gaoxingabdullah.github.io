## About Me

I am a final year Master's student in Software Engineering at Zhejiang Normal University (ZJNU), 
 where I have the privilege of being mentored and guided by Professor Wang (Robert) Hui. 
Prior to pursuing my Master's degree, I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science 
from the same university.
I'm currently serving as a 
gruduate researcher at the UbiSmart Lab, ZJNU, focusing on AI for Healthcare and 
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) under the mentorship of Professor Ma Maode and Professor Wang Hui.
