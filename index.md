## About Me

I am a final year Master's student in Software Engineering at Zhejiang Normal University, 
 where I have the privilege of being mentored and guided by Professor Wang (Robert) Hui. 
Prior to pursuing my Master's degree, I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science 
from the same university.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained invaluable experience, including an internship at China Unicom (Jinhua Branch) as a Software Engineer, where 
I worked under the supervision of Mr. Cao Jing. Additionally, I'm currently serving as a 
gruduate researcher at the UbiSmart Lab, ZJNU, focusing on AI for Healthcare and 
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) under the mentorship of Professor Ma Maode and Professor Wang Hui.
