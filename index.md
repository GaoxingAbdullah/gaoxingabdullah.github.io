## About Me

I am currently a second-year Master's student in Software Engineering at Zhejiang Normal University,
 where I have the privilege of being mentored and guided by Professor Wang (Robert) Hui. 
 Prior to pursuing my Master's degree, I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science 
 from the same university.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained invaluable experience, including an 
internship at China Unicom (Jinhua Branch) as a Software Engineer, where 
I worked under the supervision of Mr. Cao Jing. Additionally, I 
served as a research assistant at the SmartIoT Lab of ZJNU, focusing on
 the indoor localization domain under the mentorship of Professor Wang (Robert) Hui.
